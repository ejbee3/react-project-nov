# React Project for Sept Jump Course
## Challenges:
- I had some trouble working with the Unsplash API routes. With the help of Postman, I was able to retrieve a random small url photo with the search query of 'ocean'
- I had some trouble with the onclick() function for the button. You have to pass an anonymous function to the onclick attribute to get it to work properly
- I had some issues with passing props. Once I really thought about how the data flow works (I drew it out on paper), it made sense. "You'll know when you need Flux. If you aren't sure if you need it, you don't need it." *-Pete Hunt, one of the early contributors of React*

## Things I'm Proud Of:
- I like the color scheme I used, it's simple, but clean
- I like the font I found, I think it matches the scheme well
- I made the dive flag on the products page with a pixel editor!
- I like the number next to the checkout link, it's a small thing but nice for the UI.
